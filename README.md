# bank-marketing-task3
This project explores the Bank Marketing dataset using Python and machine learning. It focuses on data cleaning, visualization, encoding techniques, model training, and feature importance analysis.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE),Jupyter Notebook, VS Code.

Steps in the Project:
Data Loading & Inspection – Imported the dataset, handled delimiters, checked missing values, and explored column structures.
Data Cleaning – Filled missing values in categorical columns using mode and applied efficient techniques like dictionary mapping.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Used matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing age distributions and key patterns.
Data Encoding – Converted binary values to 0/1 and applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features.
Model Training – Built a Decision Tree Classifier and optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting.
Data Balancing – Used SMOTE to handle class imbalances, ensuring fair model training.
